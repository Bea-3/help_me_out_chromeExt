using mediarecorder I need my chrome extension to perform the following 
1. when the start recording button is clicked, let a function connect to an api endpoint to create a video stream id and get ready to receive the stream
2. let the video stream append in chunks to an array and update that api endpoint that was created.
3. when the stream ends, also update the final bytes to the endpoint.
4. save the first 30secs of the video in Js memory for an instant replay.
5. redirect the user to a page where they can play the instant replay.



// After recording is stopped and you have the video data (recordedBlob):
const instantReplayURL = 'https://example.com/instant-replay.html';

// Create a new tab with the instant replay URL:
chrome.tabs.create({ url: instantReplayURL }, (tab) => {
  console.log(`Instant replay tab created with ID: ${tab.id}`);
});
